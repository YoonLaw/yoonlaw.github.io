        Ace Cash Express, Inc. For Labor Code Violations</h2>
</section>

<section class="main-content">
    <p>
        We have filed a lawsuit against Ace Cash Express, Inc. (“ACE”) in Los Angeles County Superior Court,
        Case No. BC466415
    </p>

    <h3>This is not a lawsuit against you; you are not being sued.</h3>

    <p>
        Former employee, Adriana Lopez, seeks to represent other current and former employees of ACE Cash. Ms. Lopez
        alleges that employees could not take breaks when working alone without coverage, and were not paid for travel
        time or mileage between stores when they worked at two stores in the same day.
    </p>

    <h3>WHY WE NEED YOUR SIGNED AUTHORIZATION</h3>

    <p>
        We would like to request time and payroll records from ACE so we can calculate the amount of money we
        believe each person is entitled. To get your records, we need your written authorization. Please fill out
        the information below to start filling out the authorization form.
    </p>

    <p>
        Also, we believe the Court will allow everyone who signs authorizations to be represented in our lawsuit.
        We are not sure what will happen for those people who do not sign authorizations. To make sure you are
        eligible to be paid if we win, we recommend you send us back your written authorization.
    </p>

    <h3>THE NOSSAMAN LAW FIRM REPRESENTS ACE</h3>

    <p>
        ACE has hired the law firm of Nossaman LLP to defend the corporation. The corporation’s lawyers or investigators
        may contact you to seek information to help ACE win. If you choose to speak to the corporation’s
        representatives, please remember they do not represent your interests as an aggrieved employee. Rather, they
        have a duty to defend the corporation by outright defeating this lawsuit and/or reducing the value of your
        recovery. Everything you say to the corporation’s attorneys could be used for their goal: defeating the lawsuit
        and/or reducing your recovery.
