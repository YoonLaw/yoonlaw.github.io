        Ace Cash Express, Inc. For Labor Code Violations</h2>
    </section>

    <section class="main-content">
      <p>
        We have filed a lawsuit against Ace Cash Express, Inc. (“ACE”) in Los Angeles County Superior Court,
        Case No. BC466415.
      </p>

      <h3>This is not a lawsuit against you; you are not being sued.</h3>

      <p>
        Former employee, Adriana Lopez, seeks to represent other current and former employees of ACE Cash.
        Ms. Lopez alleges that employees could not take breaks when working alone without relief, and were
        not paid for travel time or mileage between stores when they worked at two stores in the same day,
        amongst other violations.
      </p>

      <h3>WHY WE NEED YOUR SIGNED AUTHORIZATION</h3>

      <p>
        We would like to request time and payroll records for ACE employees to calculate the amount of money
        we believe each person is owed. To get your records, we need your written authorization. Click here
        for the form.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also, we believe the Court will allow everyone who signs authorizations to be represented in our lawsuit.
        We are not sure what will happen for those people who do not sign authorizations.  To make sure you are
        eligible to be paid if we win, we recommend you send us back your written authorization.
      </p>
