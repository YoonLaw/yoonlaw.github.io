    <h3>
        Why do you need my records?
    </h3>
    <p>
        We need your records to calculate how much you’ve been harmed. Basically, Ms. Lopez believes that Ace Cash owes
        their California employees money for making them work alone without coverage. When she clocked out for meals and
        rest breaks while alone, she didn’t get a real break since she was still responsible for helping customers.
    </p>

    <p>
        Not only did she not get her breaks, since Ace didn’t pay for meal break time, she also didn’t get paid for the
        time
        she was on “lunch”.
    </p>

    <p>
        Also, Ms. Lopez sometimes worked in two centers in the same day. She wasn’t paid for her time driving between
        the
        two centers and wasn’t paid mileage either.
    </p>

    <p>Ace kept records of all these things. In order to calculate how much you were hurt, we need your records.</p>

    <h3>Is this a class action?</h3>

    <p>
        No. Ace Cash requires all its employees to agree to binding arbitration with a class action waiver. Because of
        this
        Ms. Lopez could not start a class action.
    </p>

    <h3>What is this lawsuit then?</h3>

    <p>
        Ms. Lopez filed this lawsuit after asking the State of California if it wanted to investigate Ace Cash for meal
        and
        rest breaks, travel time and mileage. Because California chose not to investigate Ace Cash, Ms. Lopez was
        allowed to
        file this lawsuit to act as a private attorney general under the Private Attorneys General Act of 2004.
    </p>

    <p>
        What this means is she is suing Ace Cash to get penalties for the benefit of employees like you.
    </p>

    <h3>Am I part of this lawsuit?</h3>

    <p>
        That’s what we are trying to do. The Court has yet not decided. What we know is that if you authorize Law
        Offices of Kenneth H. Yoon, APC to get your records, you likely will be part of the lawsuit. If you do not, you
        might be or might not be – the Court will decide.
    </p>

    <p>
        So the surest way to get paid if we win is to give us authorization for your records.
    </p>

    <h3>Do I have to pay anything? Even if Ms. Lopez loses?</h3>
    <p>
        Even if you give us your authorization, you are not a plaintiff in the lawsuit. You are not a party.
    </p>

    <h3>What can I get?</h3>

    <p>
        The Private Attorneys General Act allows for substantial penalties. These penalties are based on how many pay
        periods you worked and how much wages you are owed. That’s why we need your electronic records.
    </p>

    <h3>Why do you need my personnel records?</h3>

    <p>
        Ace Cash claims that employees can take breaks by ignoring customers and letting them wait. We believe if
        employees let customers wait while they are on break, then they will get verbal or written warnings. We would
        like
        evidence of these warning by reviewing your file. If you do not want to give us this authorization, that is
        fine.
    </p>

    <p>
        But if you know you were written up for customer complaints, and there’s a chance that complaint was related to
        you taking a break, we would really appreciate getting your authorization to get those records.
